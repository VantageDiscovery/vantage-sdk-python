The content is organized into two main sections: 

The first, [Getting Started with Vantage](https://github.com/VantageDiscovery/vantage-sdk-python/tree/develop/examples/notebooks/getting_started), includes a series of notebooks that introduce you to the basic features of Vantage. 

The second, [Use Cases](https://github.com/VantageDiscovery/vantage-sdk-python/tree/develop/examples/notebooks/use_cases), presents a variety of notebooks showcasing different ways to use Vantage. This includes both complex scenarios you may encounter and straightforward examples to kickstart your journey.

This section is organized into various notebooks, each focusing on the distinct APIs Vantage offers, specifically the **management** and **search** APIs. 

Within each notebook, you'll find comprehensive information about the supported endpoints, along with the options available for each. While some endpoints are quite intuitive, others include unique specifics. We encourage you to explore these notebooks based on where you need guidance. 

Consider these notebooks as interactive documentation that you can experiment with.
