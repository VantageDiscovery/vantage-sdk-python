# Getting Started with Vantage

Welcome to the **Getting Started with Vantage** guide. This guide is your introduction to using the Python SDK for the Vantage Discovery vector database. It's split into easy-to-follow sections:
- Client initialization notebook to get you set up
- **Management API** notebooks for account, collection and keys management
- **Search API** notebooks for discovering different search options

Whether you're new to vector databases or looking to enhance your skills, this guide will help you every step of the way. 

Let's dive in and explore the power of Vantage together!

## Vantage Discovery Account

Before diving into the content, ensure you have an account set up on the [Vantage Discovery console UI](https://vantagediscovery.com/).  

This step is crucial for accessing all the features and functionalities you'll be learning about.


## Notebooks

The notebooks in this guide are organized into two distinct folders: one dedicated to Management API calls and the other to Search API calls. Each notebook is designed to offer in-depth insights into the various options and functionalities that Vantage offers, allowing you to fully leverage its capabilities.

Starting with the client initialization notebook is a good way to get familiar with the basics. This setup helps you understand the essentials before exploring more advanced options.
